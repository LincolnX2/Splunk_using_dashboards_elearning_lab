Day 3: Introduction to Dashboards - Lab Exercises

Overview
Welcome to the Splunk Education lab environment. These lab exercises will guide you through the
process of creating basic dashboards in Splunk’s Dashboard Studio.

Scenario:You will use data from a chain of video gaming cafes named Buttercup Games Cafe. Customers can
purchase video games to play, coffee drinks and pastries using a mobile device, standard computer or
the cafe’s internal point-of-sale system

Lab Exercise 1 – Convert a Dashboard
Description
When converting a classic dashboard to the Splunk Dashboard Studio, it is important to remember what
will convert and what will not. For example, the dashboard studio does not support radio inputs. These
are converted to drop-down inputs. In the following tasks, you clone a dashboard to the Dashboard
Studio, then name the search queries used on the dashboard and adjust visualization placement.

Scenario: The Buttercup Cafe sales team wants a classic simple xml dashboard updated to the
dashboard studio.

Steps
Task 1: Change the account name and time zone
Task 2: Clone a dashboard into Dashboard Studio

Lab Exercise 2 – Create a Prototype
Description
When you create a dashboard, it is best to first create a prototype, have that reviewed by stakeholders;
then, build something more elaborate. In this lab exercise you will create a prototype for the Buttercup
Cafe sales team.

Scenario: The sales team wants a dashboard that shows cafe sales. They want to see when
sales are at their highest and how customers are placing their orders, in person or
using the cafe's app.

Steps
Task 1: Create a basic dashboard.
Task 2: Add a single value visualization.
Task 3: Add a column chart.
Task 4: Clone a visualization.
Task 5: Set the default time range.
Task 6: Add a table.

Lab Exercise 3 – Add Dynamic Coloring
Description
After stakeholders approve the prototype, begin building your dashboard with live data. Refinements
can be made later. In this lab exercise you will create a dashboard based on the prototype with one
refinement, you will add dynamic coloring to the table.

Scenario: The sales team has given approval to build a dashboard based on the prototype. One
change they want is to have the web server errors table highlighted by color for any
unusually high counts.

Steps
Task 1: Create a dashboard.
Task 2: Name the data source.
Task 3: Add Dynamic Coloring.
Task 4: Set the default time range
Task 5: Add a column chart.
Task 6: Clone a visualization.
Task 7: Add a table
Task 8: Add Dynamic Coloring.
